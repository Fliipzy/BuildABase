## Project structure

Suggested structure for the database files, so we don't have to have them on GitHub and so our path and name of them is consistent for programming purposes?  
They're all called data.tsv by default so they need to be renamed.

/database - 7 files:

1. database/name_basics.tsv
2. database/title_akas.tsv
3. database/title_basics.tsv
4. database/title_crew.tsv
5. database/title_episode.tsv
6. database/title_principals.tsv
7. database/title_ratings.tsv
